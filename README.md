AdVise (D2 Coding Buddies)

A lightweight prototype that helps marketing teams evaluate ad creatives and decide where to spend. We define clear KPIs, map content to audience categories, and experiment with a small optimization module to suggest better ad choices.  ￼

What it does
	•	Tracks core KPIs: Engagement Rate, CTR, Video Completion Rate, Cost per Lead, and ROAS.  ￼
	•	Uses RGP mapping to categorize content (e.g., Games/Entertainment, Finance/Travel, Art/Design) and adjust placement weights.  ￼
	•	Generates simple analytics reports to compare creatives and highlight what to improve.  ￼
	•	Includes experimental QAOA/VQE prototypes to pick a best ad category and normalize performance scores.  ￼

Why it’s useful
	•	Current templates lack feedback and quality signals. AdVise ties creatives to KPIs so teams can iterate with evidence and aim for better ROI.  ￼

Roadmap (short)
	•	Add more metrics and dynamic weights
	•	Collect real data to validate predictions
	•	Combine with Sparklabs-style template generation for faster testing  ￼
